                <p class="w3-large">
                    First of all, I am very honored to welcome you to James Cook University (JCU).</p>
                <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">
                    As a world-renowned institution of higher learning, James Cook University has a high degree of integration with related industries in teaching and cutting-edge scientific research results, so it is world-renowned. I firmly believe that the students will
                    embark on a new, exciting and successful overseas study journey. </p>
                </p>
                <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">As a direct campus of James Cook University, the Singapore campus has achieved outstanding results since its establishment in 2003. In 2015, it obtained the EduTrust Star certification issued by the Singapore government and became the
                    first institution in Singapore to obtain the highest level of certification. The JCU Singapore campus has achieved outstanding results in all key parts of the assessment. The evaluation process includes a comprehensive examination
                    of the academic level of the Singapore campus, the students' school experience, and the daily operation and management of the university. In 2019, the JCU Singapore campus successfully renewed the EduTrust Star certification, which
                    also proves that we have continued to do so in the four years since we obtained the certification in 2015. Setting the highest standards and strictest requirements, it has always been in the benchmark position of higher education in
                    Singapore and is highly recognized by the governments of China, New Zealand and Australia. We are committed to maintaining this status, which is also a commitment to our students to meet everyone's high expectations for academics and
                    various aspects of management. </p>
